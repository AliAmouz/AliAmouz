# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ali Amouz

🎯 **Cybersecurity Engineer | Backend Developer | Open Source Contributor**

From the heart of Morocco 🇲🇦, I’m a builder driven by the will to **secure, automate, and optimize** systems. Whether it’s writing compiler warnings in C++, automating workflows with n8n + OpenAI, or diving into eBPF to monitor the Linux kernel—I’m always chasing the deep stuff.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🛡️ Master’s in Cybersecurity @ ENSIAS  
- 💻 Freelance developer – building automation systems and intelligent agents with `n8n`, `OpenAI`, and custom backends  
- 🔍 Passionate about AppSec, Red Team tools, static analysis, and writing secure software
- ☁️ Learning Cloud Security (AWS/GCP) & Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)
- ⚙️ Self-hosting everything I can and breaking into things I shouldn't

## 🔓 Open Source & Projects

Here are some of the ideas I’ve worked on or am currently building:

- **📦 GCC Security Warnings Extension**  
  Enhance compiler diagnostics to catch buffer overflows, format strings, and TOCTOU bugs.

- **🧠 n8n + AI Agents**  
  Automate workflows, power up bots, and create backend intelligence with OpenAI's API.

- **🔥 ModSecurity Rule Engine Upgrade**  
  Improve CRS to detect modern threats: GraphQL injections, API fuzzing, evasion, and prototype pollution.

- **🐧 eBPF-based Linux Security Monitor**  
  Real-time kernel observability using low-overhead eBPF probes.
